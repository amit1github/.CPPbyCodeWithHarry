about (this) :

(this) is the type to access a object of function we are talking or the current program or function is built for.

this" -> " : member-identifier

The expression ( *this ) is commonly used to return the current object from a member function.

The this pointer is a pointer accessible only within the nonstatic member 
functions of a class, struct, or union type. It points to the object for 
which the member function is called. Static member functions don't have a this pointer.

Occasionally, the this pointer is used directly â€” for example, to manipulate 
self-referential data structures, where the address of the current object is required.
